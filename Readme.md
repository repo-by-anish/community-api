## Project Overview

This backend API project is part of a community software solution designed to provide APIs for managing communities, users, and related data. The API serves as the server-side component of the application and allows users to create and manage communities, join communities, and interact with community-related data.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Create, update, and delete communities
- Join and leave communities
- Manage community members
- Retrieve community-related data
- ...

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB or another database system
- Postman or similar tool for testing API endpoints

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-software-backend.git
   cd community-software-backend

```bash npm install```
Set up environment variables (see Environment Variables).

Initialize the database (see Database).

Start the server:
```bash npm start```


The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port you specify).
